# fast-als-python

Implementation of fast eALS algorithm (from "Fast Matrix Factorization for Online Recommandation with Implicit Feedback, https://arxiv.org/pdf/1708.05024.pdf) as part of Compressed Sensing course of ENSAE Paris.

This algorithm is coded in Python, using Numba compiler to speed up the computations.

Experiments are longly detailed in notebook file.
